# BombDiffuser

## What's this ?

First of all, do you know ```Keep Talking And Nobody Explode``` ?
If not, it's a game for 2 players. One have a Bomb in front of him and the second have a manual.
Both have to communicate to diffuse THE BOMB !
 
This project is a software to replace the manual and so, increase the diffuse speed.

## How ?
This project has been developed for Windows in VB .NET.
It handles all basic modules:
- Horizontal Wires
- Button
- Symbol Keypad
- Simon Says
- Six Words
- Number Memory
- Morse Code
- Vertical Wires
- Sequential Wires
- Maze
- Password

## Disclaimer !
This software doesn't solve the bomb for you !
It's just a help tool for the person who have the manual.
So it doesn't break the game.
